I lost my xkb keyboard configuration in a crash recently. Until this
afternoon I've been switching back and forth between swedish and us
layout. It's not nice so today I decided to recreate my us variant
again:

{% highlight c++ %}
partial alphanumeric_keys
xkb_symbols "davve" {
   include "us"
   name[Group1]= "US with Swedish on top";

   key <AD11> { [ bracketleft,  braceleft, aring,      Aring] };
   key <AC10> {	[ semicolon,	colon,     adiaeresis, Adiaeresis] };
   key <AC11> {	[ apostrophe,	quotedbl,  odiaeresis, Odiaeresis] };

   include "level3(ralt_switch)"
};
{% endhighlight %}

This little gem lets me have the sane us keyboard but still output
Swedish characters easy enough by pressing right alt and the key where
it is on a swedish keyboard.

Hopefully I won't loose it as easily now. The problem is that I store
this inside /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us and not in my home
directory. If I could keep it in $HOME, I would be happy but putting
it here has to do for now.
